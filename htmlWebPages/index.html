  <h2>HTML</h2> 

  <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. It uses a system of tags to define the content and structure of a webpage, telling a web browser how to display headings, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML is often used with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and JavaScript for dynamic functionality to build rich web experiences.</p>

  <h2>CSS</h2>

  <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of documents written in a markup language like HTML or XML. It is a fundamental technology for web development, working in conjunction with HTML (which provides the structure and content) and JavaScript (which handles interactivity).</p>

  <h2>JavaScript</h2>

  <p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamically typed, and interpreted programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on web pages. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, working alongside HTML (which provides structure) and CSS (which provides styling).</p>

  <h2>Node js</h2>

  <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Traditionally, JavaScript was confined to client-side web development within browsers, but Node.js extends its capabilities to server-side and network applications.</p>
